# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

I created a 3-column preview card component, featuring a modern-looking UI design that is responsive to all screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). To achieve responsiveness, I used a grid layout complemented by media queries.
